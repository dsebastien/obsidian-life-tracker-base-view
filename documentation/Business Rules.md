# Business Rules

This document defines the core business rules. These rules MUST be respected in all implementations unless explicitly approved otherwise.

---

## Documentation Guidelines

When a new business rule is mentioned:

1. Add it to this document immediately
2. Use a concise format (single line or brief paragraph)
3. Maintain precision - do not lose important details for brevity
4. Include rationale where it adds clarity

## Date Anchor Resolution

Priority order for resolving an entry's date:

1. Filename pattern (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-Www, YYYY-MM, YYYY-Qq)
2. Configured date anchor property
3. File metadata (ctime, mtime)

## Configuration Priority

1. Per-view column config overrides global presets
2. Global presets match by case-insensitive property name
3. Unconfigured properties show selection card

## Visualization Types

- Scale-supporting types: Heatmap, BarChart, LineChart, AreaChart, RadarChart, ScatterChart, BubbleChart
- Non-scale types: PieChart, DoughnutChart, PolarAreaChart, TagCloud, Timeline
- Color scheme-supporting types: Heatmap, BarChart, LineChart, AreaChart, PieChart, DoughnutChart, RadarChart, PolarAreaChart, ScatterChart, BubbleChart, Timeline
- Non-color scheme types: TagCloud

## Maximize State

- Only configured cards (with `data-property-id`) participate in maximize/minimize
- Unconfigured cards are hidden when another card is maximized, but never receive maximize state
- Escape key minimizes the currently maximized card

## Property Types in Visualizations

All property types are supported for visualization rendering:

- `note.*` - frontmatter properties from notes (e.g., `note.energy_level`)
- `formula.*` - computed formula columns in Bases (e.g., `formula.weekly_average`)
- `file.*` - file metadata (e.g., `file.ctime`, `file.mtime`, `file.size`)

## Animation and State Transitions

- Ongoing animations must be stopped before maximizing or minimizing a visualization

## Release Tags

- Tags MUST NOT have 'v' prefix per Obsidian plugin spec (e.g., `1.0.0` not `v1.0.0`)

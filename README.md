# Life Tracker Plugin for Obsidian

Capture and visualize the data that matters in your life. This Obsidian plugin adds:

- A new "Life Tracker" Base View type that transforms your tracked data into beautiful heatmaps, charts, and other visualizations (12+)
- The ability to customize each "Life Tracker" Base view (e.g., time granularity, date anchor property, layout, default chart type, show grid lines, ...)
- The possibility to define visualization presets (associations between a property name and specific visualization settings)

Coming soon: support for easily capturing/updating data for the properties you care about (e.g., health, sleep, nutrition, exercise, mood, etc). This will be fully customizable!
